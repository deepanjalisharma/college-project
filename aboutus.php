<p>Computer is one thing without which we cannot imagine our life. <br>It has become an important part of life for the modern day people. Computer has been introduced as a compulsory subject in schools to help the kids learn about the same from an early age. <br>It is essential to teach students about this machine as this is what they would be required to work on as they grow up.

The current working generation had to attend special training programs to learn about the various aspects and uses of the computers in order to use them. However, the newer generation is being taught about it as a subject in school so that they do not face any such problem in the future. Special computer labs are set up in the schools and trained computer teachers are employed to teach the subject.

Knowledge about the use of computer is indeed essential these days. This is because most of the tasks today are carried out via these machines.
